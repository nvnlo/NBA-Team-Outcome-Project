# NBA Team Outcome Predictor Machine Learning Project

The objective of this project was to build five machine learning models to predict the outcome of an NBA team in a given season. Each team was manually classified into one of seven different outcomes based on a number of various descriptive metrics from that season. This project implements K-Nearest Neighbors, Elastic Net Regression, Gradient Boosted Tree, Random Forest and Neural Network models to determine the best results.
