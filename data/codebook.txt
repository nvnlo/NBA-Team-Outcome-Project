If there is a predictor that has `_per_100_poss`, it is signifying a stat per 100 possessions, which is rather self-explanatory but I thought I'd save the explanation on each individual metric.

`win_pct`: Team's win percentage for the given regular season.
`fga_per_100_poss`: Field goals attempted (everything excluding free throws)
`fg_percent`: Field goal percentage
`x3p_per_100_poss`: Three-pointers attempted
`x3p_percent`: Three-point percentage
`ft_percent`: Free throw percentage
`orb_per_100_poss`: Number of Offensive rebounds
`drb_per_100_poss`: Number of Defensive rebounds
`trb_per_100_poss`: Total rebounds
`ast_per_100_poss`: Number of Assists
`stl_per_100_poss`: Number of Steals
`blk_per_100_poss`: Number of Blocks
`tov_per_100_poss`: Number of Turnovers
`pf_per_100_poss`: Number of fouls a team commits
`pts_per_100_poss`: Amount of points the team scores
`sos`: Strength of schedule, calculated by the win percentages of opponents
`d_rtg`: Defensive rating, or the amount of points allowed per 100 poss
`pace`: Pace, or the reason for using per 100 possessions data, as pace is very variable between                 eras. It is calculated by the number of possessions that occur during a 48-minute game. 
`f_tr`: Free throw rate, calculated as free throws attempted per field goal attempt.
`outcome`: Outcome variable, 7 numbered tiers representing team success (1 highest, 7 lowest)
